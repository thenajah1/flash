All my clothing comes from thrift stores so I don't really worry about company ethics or what it's made from since my money isn't going toward supporting them good or bad. Though I would like to know more about the thrift stores I shop at an their impact and ethics and stuff.","Tl;dr: 

- Clothing using a unit of measurement for size instead of an arbitrary number.
- More styles for men.
- Reasonable prices.
- Less 'production line' and more unique.
- Clothing that isn't currently 'in style'.

Long version:

Anything that doesn't make me look fat. Things that fit right. Clothing with real units of measurement instead of random numbers that mean nothing for size. I have an eating disorder, so when I am 00 in one size but 0 in another it makes me feel even fatter, which I know is dumb. If clothing could all just have waist, hip, inseam, etc measurements life would be much easier and buying clothing would be less stressful, even for 'normal' people. Also, things that fit are usually way too short, which is annoying.

More 'fun' or stylish or whatever 'guys' clothing. I guess just in general clothing geared more towards body type rather than gender? Like, to me, lots of dress styles don't look good on typical male body types simply cause the way the dress fits. If designers were to design dresses for a male body type, I think it would look good. It would be nice if certain colours, styles, patterns, etc. weren't excluded by gender. I feel like there would be a lot more of a selection and way to express ones self.

Even at thrift stores these days (at least where I live) prices have gone up like crazy. I can get new stuff from Walmart or Target for about the same price or a few dollars more and it will probably last longer, but I really hate buying from them. Other stores like Kohls do have 'sales' (read: prices marked up so they can call it on sale later) which can also be about the same price. 

Part of the reason I like thrift stores is I'm not supporting stores that have potentially poor practices, and I also am not just picking up a shirt out of a million others that look like it. Sure, it was at one point, but it kinda makes it more fun, especially if it is a more unique item. It is nice to find things that aren't the typical 'in style' thing, but still looks nice.

There is plenty of fashion throughout history that still looks nice, just isn't currently in style. I swear last time I browsed Target everything was a crop top with either a triangle and some 'deep' saying, Native American print and had little tassels hanging from it, or all lace. I just want options outside of whatever 'trend' is in.

Anyway hope that is what you were looking for, and hope it made sense.","Honestly, I would like to see something like 3D printed clothing. That way you could choose colour, size, etc. and have it tailored to your body without additional cost. Fewer garments would be made and potentially wasted (not only material wise, but time to make, pack, ship, stock, etc., and gas to transport...all that jazz).
